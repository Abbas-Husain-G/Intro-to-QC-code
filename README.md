# Intro-to-QC-code
Assignment 2 (Assignment 1 consisted of theoretical questions)

We started off with learning the bascis of quantum mechanics. We were asked to read chapter 3 of Griffith's introduction to Quantum Mechanics and 2 meets were conducted, 1 by each mentor, explaining all the important concepts in detail and notes were provided after both the meets. Then we entered into quantum computing in which we were given a code tutorial and we had to learn from it and complete a coding assignment.
